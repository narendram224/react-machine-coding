# React Recursive Folder Component

A React component that renders a folder and file structure similar to a file explorer. The folder structure is dynamically rendered based on a configuration file, and folders can be expanded or collapsed.

Features
Recursively renders folders and files from a given configuration.
Displays a "+" icon for collapsed folders and a "-" icon for expanded folders.
Allows for easy customization of folder and file structures using a configuration object.
Supports modern React with modular CSS styling.

## Usage

To use the `Folder` component in your application:

1.  Import the `Folder` component and the configuration data in your main application file (e.g., `App.tsx`):

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Folder from "./components/Folder/Folder";
import { folderConfig } from "./components/Folder/folder.config";
import styles from "./components/Folder/Folder.module.css";
function App() {
  return (
    <div div className={styles.folderContainer}>
      <Folder config={folderConfig} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

2.  Ensure your `folder.config.ts` file contains the configuration data for your folder structure.

## Configuration

The folder structure is defined using a TypeScript interface `FolderConfigProps`. Here’s an example configuration:

```javascript
export interface FolderConfigProps {
  type: "folder" | "file";
  name: string;
  children: FolderConfigProps[];
}

export const folderConfig: FolderConfigProps[] = [
  {
    type: "folder",
    name: "node_modules",
    children: [
      {
        type: "folder",
        name: "@types",
        children: [
          {
            type: "file",
            name: "react.d.ts",
            children: [],
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        type: "folder",
        name: "react",
        children: [
          {
            type: "file",
            name: "index.d.ts",
            children: [],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    type: "file",
    name: "README.md",
    children: [],
  },
];
```

### Customization

Styling: Modify Folder.module.css to customize the appearance of folders, files, and icons.

### Icons:

Expand/Collapse icons (+ and -) can be replaced with custom icons by editing the Folder.tsx file.
Behavior: Add additional features (e.g., file click handlers) by extending the Folder or FolderItem components.

### Folder Structure Visualization

The `Folder` component will render folders with a "+" icon when collapsed and a "-" icon when expanded. Files will be displayed without any icons.
