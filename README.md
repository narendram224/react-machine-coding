Displays a "+" icon for collapsed folders and a "-" icon for expanded folders.
Allows for easy customization of folder and file structures using a configuration object.
Supports modern React with modular CSS styling.

## Usage

To use the `Folder` component in your application:

1.  Import the `Folder` component and the configuration data in your main application file (e.g., `App.tsx`):

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Folder from "./components/Folder/Folder";
import { folderConfig } from "./components/Folder/folder.config";
import styles from "./components/Folder/Folder.module.css";
function App() {
  return (
    <div div className={styles.folderContainer}>
      <Folder config={folderConfig} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

2.  Ensure your `folder.config.ts` file contains the configuration data for your folder structure.

## Configuration

The folder structure is defined using a TypeScript interface `FolderConfigProps`. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```javascript
export interface FolderConfigProps {
  type: "folder" | "file";
  name: string;
  children: FolderConfigProps[];
}

export const folderConfig: FolderConfigProps[] = [
  {
    type: "folder",
    name: "node_modules",
    children: [
      {
        type: "folder",
        name: "@types",
        children: [
          {
            type: "file",
            name: "react.d.ts",
            children: [],
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        type: "folder",
        name: "react",
        children: [
          {
            type: "file",
            name: "index.d.ts",
            children: [],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    type: "file",
    name: "README.md",
    children: [],
  },
];
```

### Customization

Styling: Modify Folder.module.css to customize the appearance of folders, files, and icons.

### Icons:

Expand/Collapse icons (+ and -) can be replaced with custom icons by editing the Folder.tsx file.
Behavior: Add additional features (e.g., file click handlers) by extending the Folder or FolderItem components.

### Folder Structure Visualization

The `Folder` component will render folders with a "+" icon when collapsed and a "-" icon when expanded. Files will be displayed without any icons.

## Folder Structure

Here's how your project directory should look:

```bash
/react-folder-structure
â”œâ”€â”€ /public
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ /src
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ /components
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ /Folder
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Folder.tsx
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ folder.config.ts
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Folder.module.css
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

2. Use the `OtpComponent` in your application:

```javascript
function App() {
  const handleOtpComplete = (otp) => {
    console.log("OTP entered:", otp);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <OtpComponent length={6} onComplete={handleOtpComplete} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the OTP component with custom classes:
